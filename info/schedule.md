##  Mid-Term Details

- Online quiz (on Blackboard, no need to be in class).
- Opened on specific time (14:45), under 'Assignments'.
- Contains 20 randomized multiple choice questions.
- You have 50 minutes (5 minutes troubleshooting time incorporated) to answer
  them, the test auto-submits if you are not finished before.
- Must be completed in one sitting, no backtracking possible.
- So: Manage your time well and think carefully about your answers!

The midterm will test your theoretical knowledge and practical insights (not skills) regarding the material we have discussed at that point, and serves as both a way to gauge your comprehension of the basic material (first 4 weeks), and as preparation for the final exam. As such, the way to prepare for them is to study the associated lectures (and notes), and papers. **Important**: there is **no** resit for the midterm!
