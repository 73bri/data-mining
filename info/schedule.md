##  In-class Details

- in class
- closed book
- multiple choice
- pen and paper
- no calculator needed
- about 20 questions each
- 25% of grade per test

They will test your practical knowledge and developed insights regarding the material we have discussed at that point **in the practicals**. As such, the way to prepare for them is to thoroughly go through the steps taken in the notebooks, and applying the same principles to the different datasets we provide. This should build up a routine and a way of thinking that will help you through the test. There will be no "Orange-specific questions"; like "say I would want to merge dataset `X1` and `X2`, what widget would you use for that".

Expect questions about:
- data (and visualizations)
- features
- models
- evaluation
- best-practices in your workflow

## In-class Resit

There is **one** resit for the in-class practicals. With this, you can try to improve or fill your grade for **one** of the tests (thus only counting for 25%). The material will cover *all* of the practicals. Further details will be announced.
